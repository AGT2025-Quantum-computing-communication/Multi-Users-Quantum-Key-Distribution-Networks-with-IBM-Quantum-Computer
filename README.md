# Multi-Users Quantum Key Distribution Networks with IBM-Quantum Computer
This project showcases multi-users QKD networks on IBM-Quantum Computer (IBM-Boston). We demonstrate and implemente multi-parties QKD based on the famous E91 protocol. Up to our knowledge, this is the first ever time to implement multi-users entanglement based QKD on IBM-quantum computer simulating the real condition, with an infinite number of users, who are able to share entangled photonic qubits over unauthenticated quantum channels. It additionally implemente eavesdropper testing by demonstrating the violation of $N$-particles Svelitchny inequality. The example here considered showcases the working principle for 6 users, on ideal conditions (no eavesdropper) on one hand and assuming the worst scenario where the source is totally under eavesdropper's control who can perform the intercept-and-resend attack on the other hand. We then first  simulated the algorithm on ideal backend (Qiskit Aer Simulator) where only shot noise is considered, and on real backend (IBM-Boston), where qubits are totally noisy. The results  show sucessful distribution of secure key to all parties with a lenght of 600 bits, a 0% quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the Svelitchny upper bound of 36.72, close to the theoretical value of 37$\sqrt{2}$. This is obtained in ideal conditions (i.e. no eavesdropper and no extra noise appart from shot noise). However the eavesdropper testing implementation clearly demonstrate the violation of Svelitchny inequality exposing the eavesdropper to detection by legitimate users, and the QBER increased to more than 7% due to eavesdropper interference. 

The same simulation carried on the real quantum backend gave a smaller secrete key length (499 bits), a QBER of $7.75\%$ and the Svelitchny upper bound of -1.638 when no eavesdropper interferred with the qubits but the latest are too noisy. However, when an eavesdropper interfer with those noisy qubits, we obtain a much more smaller secrete key length (499 bits), a QBER of $20.75\%$ and the Svelitchny upper bound of -1.638. These results demonstrate that under a noisy environment, our multi-users QKD protocol might not be hundred per cent efficient since the QBER over pass the threshold value of $5%$ even when there is no eavesdropper in the middle. But with a performant error correction algorithm like the low density parity check (LDPC) for example, this can be improved.
