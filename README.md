# Multi-Users Quantum Key Distribution Networks with IBM-Quantum Computer
This project showcases multi-users QKD networks on IBM-Quantum Computer (IBM-Boston). We demonstrate and implemente multi-parties QKD based on the famous E91 protocol. Up to our knowledge, this is the first ever time to implement multi-users entanglement based QKD on IBM-quantum computer simulating the real condition, with an infinite number of users, who are able to share entangled photonic qubits over unauthenticated quantum channels.
